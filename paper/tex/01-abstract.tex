Similarity of competitors has been proposed to facilitate coexistence of species because it slows down competitive exclusion, thus making it easier for equalizing mechanisms to maintain diverse communities. On the other hand, chaos can promote coexistence of species. Here we link these two previously unrelated findings, by analyzing the dynamics of food web models. We show that near-neutrality of competition of prey, in the presence of predators, increases the chance of developing chaotic dynamics. Moreover we confirm that this results in a higher biodiversity. Our results suggest that near-neutrality may promote biodiversity in two ways: through reducing the rates of competitive displacement and through promoting non-equilibrium dynamics.
