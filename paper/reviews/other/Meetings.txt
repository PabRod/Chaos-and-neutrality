Structure:
	Generate
	Analyze
	
Questions:
	Pipelining
		Extract time series
		Define model programatically
			Silent mode
			Create a batch of numerical experiments
		
	Re-run model from data
	
Other:
	GitHub integration
	
Non-technical:
	Summer school
	
Interesting case: i = 8, j = 1
Expand time series and/or stabilization period

Less priority: MatCont

commands:
	savepars
	par('-v') % Parameters saved in full precision
	run.params as commands
	model('model', g_grind.model, 'commands', g_grind.commands)
	
	Try setdimension. May not work

Hypotheses:

    We expect reducing H to make the system less chaotic

Reads and insights:

    Get some insights working with small models
        Hopf bifurcation expected with 1P and 1p

    Read Hubbell's book

    Read about the paradox of enrichment in Marten's book on shallow lakes
        Hopf and transcritical bifurcations controlled by carrying capacity

    Look just at competition (no predators)

Technical details:

    Check coexistance in the long term
    Find a way to count extinctions (remember there is an inflow term)
    Measure inequality
    Relate all it with chaos
    Compute rand(n) once... or on each run?
    Take a look at function nmaxima. cyclic + nonperiodic => chaos
