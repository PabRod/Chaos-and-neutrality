Does this article or an earlier version of this article appear on the Web (e.g., preprint archives, dissertation archives)? If yes, where does it appear? Preprint repositories must be noncommercial (e.g., arXiv and bioRxiv). Commercial publishers such as PeerJ are not eligible. Preprints should have noncommercial licenses (CC-BY-NC) or no licenses. Preprints in a noncommercial repository licensed for all commercial reuse (CC-BY) require a CC-BY license in the journal and the payment of APCs to cover the real unsubsidized costs. Preprints that have been accepted after full editorial review in a preprint overlay journal (e.g., Peer Community In journals) are already published (accepted, final, licensed, permanent, citable) and are not eligible for submission.
