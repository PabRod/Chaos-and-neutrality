Dear editor,

please find enclosed our article: "Neutral competition boosts chaos in food webs".

In the present work, we look from a different perspective to a classic and much debated problem in ecology: why are there so many species while there are so few niches?

Chaos and (near)neutrality are among the suggested mechanisms that could enhance biodiversity, but have never been related to each other. This may be explained by the fact that a relation between chaos and neutrality seems counterintuitive, as fully neutral ecosystems can't be chaotic.

Using numerical simulations, we unify these concepts by showing that food webs with near-neutral competition more commonly display chaotic dynamics. Being chaos not possible in neutral communities without predation, we find this insight surprising. Therefore, we think that our study could change the way people think about chaos and neutrality: not as mutually exclusive explanations but as two interacting mechanisms. As the explanation for high biodiversity is a classic and still debated problem in ecology, we think that our manuscript could be interesting for the broad readership of American Naturalist.

In the spirit of reproducible research, we provide a set of scripts that, from basic principles and with a single click, generate the whole set of results and figures.

Kind regards,
