\section{Results}
\label{sec:Results}
Plotting the probability of chaos against the competition parameter (see figure \ref{fig:Results}), we observe a clear maximum around $ \epsilon = 0 $. The likelihood of chaotic behaviour for neutral competition at the prey's trophic level is thus higher than for dominant inter or intraspecific competition. This result remains true for systems with a different number of species (figures \ref{fig:Results} and \ref{fig:Contour}).

The overall likelihood of chaos, which can be interpreted as the area under the curve in figure \ref{fig:Results}, increases with the size of the food web. This effect should not be surprising: the more dimensions the phase space has, the easier is to fulfill the requirements of the complex geometry of a chaotic attractor \cite{Strogatz1994}. We can understand this intuitively as increasing the available room for the trajectories to pack closer and closer without ever crossing each other nor collapsing to a point. Even in those higher dimensional cases, there is still a clear maximum at neutral competition.

% Weak and strong interspecific competition
Another local maximum was observed around $ \epsilon = -1 $. This means that weak competitive coupling, in our model, also promotes chaos.

Between both local maxima there is obviously a local minimum whose exact position differed between simulations.

The overall probability of chaos, understood as the area under the curve, grows with the system size. The local maximum stays at $\epsilon = 0$ even for systems with a high number of species.}

The consumers' population is fixed as $ 2/3 $ of the prey's population. Notice that chaotic attractors appear more easily (i.e., for smaller systems) the closer is the competition to neutral (i.e., $ \epsilon = 0 $).}
